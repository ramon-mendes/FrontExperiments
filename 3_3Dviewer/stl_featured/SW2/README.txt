# Summary

Oi M8 this TIE Fighter is so rad you won't even know unless you print it out m80! Drop a Like if ye' please my goal is 25! You can print this in one of three ways. The bigger the print, the less fragile the pieces are.   
1) The whole ship...  
2) The two wings and the body (requires soldering to make room for the wing to fit in and fit pieces together)...   
3) The whole ship cut in half (requires soldering two fit two pieces together, the wings are more fragile due to the thinness of the connector)...  


# Instructions

I made this radical TIE Fighter using Tinkercad and based it off of images I found on the internet. I did my best to detail the starship as close to an actual TIE Fighter from Star Wars M8.
